# C64-PSU
A C64/C128/Vic20 PSU
This is a full replacement PSU with modern electronics that won't kill your computer when it gets bad.. the original PSU's short input to output, when they break, feeding approx 10v.

The PSU can be used for the C64 even with i.e. 1541 Ultimate and Vic20, and it's powerful enough to feed the C128 and/or 17xx REU.

All parts can be bought at tme.eu, and the pcb has been designed with parts from there.
A few parts like the DIN connector can be aqcuired from ebay where they're much cheaper.

If you are a reseller, and use my designs, though the projects are open source, I'd like to ask you to donate a small amount of money, to cancer research for each sold device.
